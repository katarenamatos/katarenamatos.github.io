  I am Senior Scientist and "Privatdozent" for Physical Geography and Hydrology at the Department of Geography, University of Zurich.
  <br>
  <br>
  My main research interest is centred on water in mountain areas, both in the Alps as well as world-wide.
  Within this topic, I try to answer questions concerning water resources, natural hazards and hydrological processes.
  I’m also particularly interested in changes in the Earth system, especially as regards climate and land use as well as demographic and socio-economic developments.
  <br>
  <br>
  I mainly work with computer models and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) as well as statistical analyses of observed data.
  Besides this, I can draw from hands-on experience in hydraulic engineering, flood estimation and natural hazards assessments in mountainous regions of Switzerland.
  <br>
  <br>
  Every now and then I like to take pictures, you will a few of them around here as well.
